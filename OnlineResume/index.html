        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>The IoT-based software project aimed to enhance the safety and convenience of students by providing real-time bus location information through a dedicated mobile app.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It involves integrating IoT devices onto school and college buses to track their live location using GPS technology. The buses were equipped with GPS. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    A mobile application was developed as part of the project, allowing students to log in and access the live location of their respective school or college buses. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    The IoT system continuously transmitted the bus location data to the server. This ensured that students could accurately track the buses and plan their schedules accordingly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The project implemented secure login mechanisms for students, ensuring that only authorized individuals could access the bus location information.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The mobile app sent alerts to students when the bus was approaching their location or if there were any changes in the bus schedule.
